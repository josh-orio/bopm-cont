This manual is a shorthand reference for some controls in the User Interface.
For an extended user manual, including how to price options and display graphs, refer to the 'User Manual' section of the README.

Controls:
NOTE: Every page will list relevant controls at the top!

Up & down arrows (↑ /↓ ) are used in every interface to move between elements and content.

The enter key (↵) is used to select/deselect an element of an interface (applies to Menus, Inputs & Tables).

Left and right arrows (← /→ ) are used to 'finalize', which means you press them when you are 'done' with a certain interface.
The usage of these arrows varies so check at the top of your interface which is effective.

Interfaces:
Menu - used to select between options.

Input - lets you input values, use the enter key to select/deselect fields. Some fields may have pre-specified options, which will open another menu interface.

Info - used to present information, such as this manual or pricing information. For long texts, users can scroll using up and down arrows.

Table - used in cases where lots of data is presented, can be interactive for data entry too.
